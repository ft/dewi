Dependencies.

    Dewi requires Perl5 and a number of stardard Perl5 modules (like
    "English", "File::Spec", "Cwd" and others).

    It can optionally use the IPC::Run3 module from CPAN. This is required
    to allow external filters to be run. On debian systems, installing the
    `libipc-run3-perl' package will do the trick.

    For building the documentation, the txt2tags[1] package is required.

Installation.


      I. Usage directly from the source package

    To use the dewi script directly from the source package, you need to
    do this:

        % make

    Say the source package is located at `/usr/src/dewi-0.2', you would
    now use the script directly from there:

        % /usr/src/dewi-0.3/dewi <operation>

    That's all.

    For convenience, if you got "$HOME/bin" in your "$PATH":

        % ln -s /usr/src/dewi-0.3/dewi ~/bin/dewi


      II. Installation to the system.

    You can also install everything to the system like you would do with
    any other software package. These are the required steps:

        % make sys
        % make install

    After that the `dewi' script should be located in `/usr/local/bin'. If
    you would like another installation prefix, use:

        % make sys prefix=/my/preferred/prefix
        % make install prefix=/my/preferred/prefix


      III. Documentation

    The package also comes with documentation in form of txt2tags markup,
    from which manpages are generated. In order to generate and install
    these manpages, use these commands:

        % make doc
        % make install-doc


      IV. Last words

    There is also a zsh completion for the maintenance helper `dewi' in
    `_dewi'. Put it somewhere in $fpath before calling `compinit' in your
    zshrc. See zsh's manual for details.


Usage.

    See the included dewi(7), dewi(1) and dewifile(5) manuals.


Compatibility with previous versions.

    Previously, dewi depended on the `make' utility to dispatch to its
    various operations. That was a bad idea for multiple reasons. Keeping
    the main dewi script in ".dewi/bin" was another design mistake. Now
    all functionality is part of the `dewi' frontend script.

    At this point in time the documentation does not reflect these
    changes. But basically, what used to be:

        % make deploy

    is now:

        % dewi deploy

    ...and so on. Also, the contents of the .dewi directory changed to
    avoid incompatibilities. In any case, an UPGRADE document is due for
    the next release.

    There is a tag in the project's version control history that marks the
    last changeset, that depended on make. If you wish to keep using it
    (in which case you're completely on your own), you can get a branch
    that depends on said commit by doing this:

        % git checkout -b my-dewi-fork last-make-based-changeset

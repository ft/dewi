    dewi - deploy and withdraw configuration files  |
----------------------------------------------------+

Dependencies.

    Dewi requires Perl5, a posix sh and a make implementation (GNU and
    BSD should both work).

    For building the documentation, the txt2tags[1] package is required.

    [1] <http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/>


Installation.

    For the most part, dewi works autonomous. If and where the files from
    this package are installed on a system does not matter to it. There
    is, however, a script called `dewi', too. It helps with initialising
    and updating the `.dewi' directory in the parent directory and all
    dewi related Makefiles in that tree. So, basically you want to be
    able to do these operations:

        % dewi init
        % dewi update

    There are two ways of using this script. One is directly from this
    source package, the other is installing the source package to the
    system.


      I. From the source package

    To use the dewi script directly from the source package, you need to
    do this:

        % make

    Say the source package is located at `/usr/src/dewi-0.2', you would
    now use the script directly from there:

        % /usr/src/dewi-0.2/dewi <operation>

    That's all.


      II. Installation to the system.

    You can also install everything to the system like you would do
    with any other software package. These are the required steps:

        % make sys
        % make install

    After that the `dewi' script should be located in `/usr/local/bin'.
    If you would like another installation prefix, use:

        % make sys prefix=/my/preferred/prefix
        % make install prefix=/my/preferred/prefix


      III. Documentation

    The package also comes with documentation in form of txt2tags markup,
    from which manpages are generated. In order to generate and install
    these manpages, use these commands:

        % make doc
        % make install-doc

Usage.

    See the included dewi(7), dewi(1) and dewifile(5) manuals.
